    \section{DCE for slicing dead code}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Dead Code Elimination (DCE) is a compiler optimization used to remove \textbf{ineffectual} code.
    "Pre-live" statements like line 6, which affect system state, form the slicing basis for DCE. \\
    \input{dce.tex}

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{Slicing the Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    DCE can evolve into a \textbf{flexible slicing technique} by redefining what is considered as "pre-live".
    The \texttt{pragma} in line 9 characterizes line 10 as "pre-live", with the dependency on \texttt{j} considered satisfied. \\
    \input{spmv.tex}
    Shaded in green is exclusively "live" code, shaded in red is exclusively "dead" code, and code in yellow is common to both.

    \section{Slice arrangement}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Slices, mapped to threads, are arranged in a dataflow manner using queues for inter-slice communication, which carry both data and control tokens. \\

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{Microarchitectural challenges}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The slicing requires ISA-visible queues, which should support:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item low-latency, fine-grained and blocking push/pop operations
    \item low-latency checks for control flow tokens
    \end{itemize}
